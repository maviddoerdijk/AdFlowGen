# Welcome

Open main.py for instructions on running the code

# Installation

Running the code requires many different API keys, which I can unfortunately not give in the repo.

Recommended to run with Python 3.11.

Pytube is a very unstable module, therefore it is important to use the specific python version and specific ffmpeg version. Other problems could still come up due to problems with other OS or other reasons.

## Required installations (programs)

ffmpeg : v3.4.2

### install with choco using commands:

choco install ffmpeg --version=3.4.2

### install with apt using commands:

sudo apt-get install ffmpeg=3.4.2
